# automator-encrypt-files
This Automator Service Workflow will take the files you've selected in the Finder, bundle them in a tarball, and then gzip them. For good measure, it also applies OpenSSL AES 256-bit encryption.

I make no warranties as to how well this will work for you (it works great for me), and will probably ignore this repository as far as updates go. Hey, at least I'm honest!
